Your objective: Maintain public trust and social cohesion in the face of coordinated disinformation campaigns designed to undermine the peacekeeping mission and reignite sectarian tensions.

You have limited manpower. Every response costs resources. Choose wisely.

Your decisions will shift the Information Environment Meter between fragmentation and unity. Let it drift too far toward fragmentation, and the mission fails. Keep it stable or trending toward unity, and you succeed.

There are no perfect answers. Only informed decisions under pressure.`,beginButton:"Begin Mission"},t={title:"Settings",muteButton:"Toggle Sound",unmuteButton:"Sound On",soundToggle:"Sound",soundOn:"On",soundOff:"Off",saveGameButton:"Save Game",loadGameButton:"Load Game",saveSuccess:"Game saved successfully!",loadSuccess:"Game loaded successfully!",noSavedGame:"No saved game found."},n={appTitle:"NARRATIVE FRONT",appSubtitle:"Strategic Communications Coordinator",manpowerLabel:"Manpower",roundLabel:"Round",ofLabel:"of",adversaryInject:"ADVERSARY INJECT",tabScenario:"Scenario",tabResponse:"Response",tabFilter:"Filter",yourResponse:"Your Response",manpowerAllocated:"Manpower Allocated",confirmButton:"Confirm Response",filterChatTitle:"Filter - Tactical Advisor",filterChatPlaceholder:"Filter will provide guidance..."},a={title:"Intelligence Assessment",threatLevelCritical:"CRITICAL THREAT",threatLevelHigh:"HIGH THREAT",threatLevelModerate:"MODERATE THREAT",hoursActiveLabel:"Hours Active",hoursActiveUnit:"hrs",hoursActiveDesc:"Duration this narrative has been circulating",botAmplificationLabel:"Bot Amplification",botAmplificationUnit:"%",botAmplificationDesc:"Estimated percentage of coordinated inauthentic activity",damageLabel:"Damage Potential",damagePotentialLabel:"Damage Potential",damagePotentialScale:"/10",damagePotentialDesc:"Potential impact if narrative goes unchecked",veracityLabel:"Veracity Assessment",veracityDesc:"Factual accuracy of the core claim",emotionalResonanceLabel:"Emotional Resonance",emotionalResonanceScale:"/10",emotionalResonanceDesc:"Psychological impact and visceral appeal",veracityTrue:"True",veracityMostlyTrue:"Mostly True",veracityMisleading:"Misleading",veracityFalse:"False"},o={menuButton:"Open settings menu",closeMenu:"Close menu",closeButton:"Close",selectedResponse:"Selected response"},s={ignore:{title:"Ignore",description:"Do not respond.
