Your objective: Maintain public trust and social cohesion in the face of coordinated disinformation campaigns designed to undermine the peacekeeping mission and reignite sectarian tensions.

You have limited manpower. Every response costs resources. Choose wisely.

Your decisions will shift the Information Environment Meter between fragmentation and unity. Let it drift too far toward fragmentation, and the mission fails. Keep it stable or trending toward unity, and you succeed.

There are no perfect answers. Only informed decisions under pressure.`,beginButton:"Begin Mission"},t={title:"Settings",muteButton:"Toggle Sound",unmuteButton:"Sound On",soundToggle:"Sound",soundOn:"On",soundOff:"Off",saveGameButton:"Save Game",loadGameButton:"Load Game",saveSuccess:"Game saved successfully!",loadSuccess:"Game loaded successfully!",noSavedGame:"No saved game found."},n={appTitle:"NARRATIVE FRONT",appSubtitle:"Strategic Communications Coordinator",manpowerLabel:"Manpower",roundLabel:"Round",ofLabel:"of",adversaryInject:"ADVERSARY INJECT",tabScenario:"Scenario",tabComms:"Comms",tabDecision:"Decision",yourResponse:"Your Response",manpowerAllocated:"Manpower Allocated",confirmButton:"Confirm Response",commsTitle:"Communications - Tactical Advisor",commsPlaceholder:"Filter will provide guidance...",decisionTitle:"Decision Support"},a={title:"Select Mission Type",subtitle:"Choose your operational mode",deployButton:"Deploy Mission",comingSoon:"Coming Soon",classification:"UNCLASSIFIED",natoEE:{title:"NATO Eastern Europe",subtitle:"Scenario Mode",description:"Hand-crafted scenarios based on realistic disinformation tactics in peacekeeping operations.
