Pre-bunking saves you here - if audiences already skeptical of fake accident claims, they wait for verification. Counter-narrative risky - seems like changing subject when 'people died.' Discrediting also risky - looks defensive when emotions high. Ignoring? Catastrophic. Photos 'prove' guilt, silence confirms it."
