Every response costs resources. Choose wisely.\n\nYour decisions will shift the Information Environment Meter between fragmentation and unity. Let it drift too far toward fragmentation, and the mission fails. Keep it stable or trending toward unity, and you succeed.\n\nThere are no perfect answers. Only informed decisions under pressure.",
